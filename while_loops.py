while loops is a control statement which keeps executing 'n' times until the condition is true ..and terminate the execution when condition becomes false
while has three parts:
    1. initialization:- a value from where looop will be started
    2. condition:- the condition to be given where loop will be stoped
    3. increment or decrement :- the value that wanna be increased or decreased

like a given below example:
# i=0

# while(i<20):
#     print(i, end=" ")
#     i = i +1
